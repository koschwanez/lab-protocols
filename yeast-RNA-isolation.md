## Yeast RNA isolation
### Koschwanez, Wildenberg, Huberman modified from Collart and Oliviero, 2001

1. Add yeast culture directly to ice-cold methanol for a final methanol concentration of 60% by volume.
2. Incubate cells in methanol for 10 min at -20 &deg;C.
3. Spin down cells at max speed at 4 &deg;C and remove supernatant.
4. Resuspend in 1 ml of RNAase-free ice-cold water in a 2 ml cryogenic storage vial.
5. Spin down cells at max speed at 4 &deg;C and remove supernatant.
6. Cell pellet can be flash-frozen and held at -80 &deg;C at this point. Thaw pellet on ice before proceeding.
7. Resuspend in 400 &mu;l of TES solution (10 mM pH 7.5 Tris-Cl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS). Keep on ice.
8. Add 400 &mu;l of acid phenol. Pipette up and down 10 times to mix.
9. Incubate at 65 &deg;C for 45-60 min. Vortex for 10 s every 10 min.
10. Place on ice for 5 min. Spin down for 5 min at 4 &deg;C.
11. Pipette off top (aqueous phase), add to 400 &mu;l of acid phenol in a new 2 ml cryogenic storage vial. 
12. Place on ice for 5 min. Spin down for 5 min at 4 &deg;C.
13. Pipette off top (aqueous phase), add to 400 &mu;l of chloroform in a new 2 ml cryogenic storage vial. 
14. Spin down for 5 min at 4 &deg;C.
15. Pipette off top (aqueous phase), add to 1 ml of ethanol + 40 &mu;l of 3M sodium acetate. Incubate at -20 &deg;C for 1-2 h.
16. Spin down for 5 min at 4 &deg;C. RNA is now in pellet. Remove supernatant. Keep on ice.
17. Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol. Spin down for 5 min at 4 &deg;C. RNA is now in pellet. Remove supernatant.
18. Dry for 5-10 min on ice.
19. Add 50 &mu;l sodium citrate buffer. Let redissolve on ice for up to 1 hour. Freeze when redissolved. 
20. If using for qPCR, treat with DNase I per manufacturer's instructions. This step is not necessary if using the Illumina kit for RNA sequencing.

Tips

- All reagents, pipette tips, and tubes must be RNAase free.
- Wear gloves to prevent contamination with RNAase.
