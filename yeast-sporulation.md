## Yeast sporulation and asci digestion
### Koschwanez modified from Lacefield

1. Inoculate diploid cells in YPD and grow to saturation.
2. Dilute culture 1:50 into YP 2% potassium acetate.
3. Grow for 12-24 hours, then pellet and remove supernatant.
4. Resuspend in 2% potassium acetate.
5. Incubate on roller drum at 25 &deg;C for 4-5 days.
6. Verify sporulation on microscope.
7. To digest asci, pellet 1 ml of the sporulated culture and resuspend in 50 &mu;l of 10% Zymolyase. Incubate for 1 hour at 30 &deg;C.
8. For random spore analysis, add 400 &mu;l sterile water and 50 &mu;l 10% Triton X-100. Sonicate for 5-10 s and observe tetrad separation on microscope. Spin down slowly (<6000 RPM) and resuspend in growth media.
