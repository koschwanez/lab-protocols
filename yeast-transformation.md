## Yeast transformation with lithium acetate
### Koschwanez modified from Gottschling and Gietz

#### Preparation

- Inoculate yeast strain so that it is growing for at least 12 hours in exponential phase before transformation. Saturated cells have very poor transformation efficiency. Each transformation (and the control) will require around 1E8 cells.
- 10 &mu;l of salmon sperm DNA is required for each sample (including control). Boil the salmon sperm for 3 min at 100 &deg;C, and then immediately place on ice. Keep on ice until it is used.
- Dilute about 1 &mu;g of the DNA to be transformed into 50 &mu;l of tris buffer in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Place 50 &mu;l of tris buffer into another tube to serve as the control. The amount of DNA used can be adjusted up or down depending on the efficiency of the transformation.
- Prepare 100 mM LiAc
- Prepare the transformation mix: Make 100 mL of 50% PEG (w/v) (final 40%), add 12.5 ml of 1 M LiAc (final 100 mM) and 12.5 ml of 10 mM pH 7.5 pH TE buffer (final 1 mM).

#### Method

1. Pellet the exponentially growing cells in a Falcon tube. On the Sorvall Legend RT, 1800 RPM for 3 min is sufficient. Each transformation (and the control) will require around 1E8 cells.
2. Pour off the medium, resuspend the cells in 10-25 ml of sterile water, and centrifuge again to pellet.
3. Pour off the water, resuspend the cells in 0.5 mL 100 mM LiAc, and transfer suspension to 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.
4. Pellet the cells slowly (5000-6000 RPM for 1 min) and remove the supernatant.
5. Resuspend the cells in 100 mM LiAc to a concentration of around 2E9 cells/ml. (If there are 2E8 cells in the tube, then add approximately 50 &mu;l of LiAc for 100 &mu;l, or 2 transformations.).
6. Pipette 50 &mu;l (~1E8 cells) of cell suspension onto the DNA suspension or tris control.
7. Add 10 &mu;l of salmon sperm DNA.
8. Add 275 &mu;l of transformation mix.
9. Mix by pipetting up and down gently.
10. Heat shock at 42 &deg;C for 30 min.
11. Pellet the cells SLOWLY (5000-6000 RPM for 1 min) and remove transformation mix with a pipette.
12. If a drug marker was used, resuspend the cells in YPD, incubate while spinning or shaking at 30 &deg;C for 90 min - 2 hours, and then spin down again.
13. Resuspend pellet in 250 &mu;l of sterile water by pipetting it up and down gently.
14. Plate the suspension on the selective plate. If the transformation efficiency is expected to be high, also plate a 1:10 dilution.
15. Allow the fluid to be taken up by the plate prior to incubation.
16. Incubate the plates at 30 &deg;C until single colonies are seen (usually 1.5 - 2 days).
17. Pick single colonies and streak out on selective plates to ensure the colony is clonal.

Notes
- G. Wildenberg heat shocks at 30 &deg;C for 20 min and then 42 &deg;C for 10 min with similar results.
