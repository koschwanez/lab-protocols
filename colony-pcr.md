##Yeast colony PCR
### Koschwanez, Wildenberg, Lacefield

1. Pipette 5 &mu;l of water into a PCR tube.
2. Pick off the smallest possible bit of a yeast colony with a toothpick or pipette tip. Smash it into the water in the PCR tube.
3. Freeze the tube for 5 minutes.
4. Microwave the tube for 3 minutes.
5. Freeze the tube for 5 minutes.
6. Add remaining 45 &mu;l of PCR mix for a 50 &mu;l reaction.
7. PCR as normal.

Tips:

- Standard TAQ does not work well. Use Phusion instead.
- Freezing at -80 &deg;C works better than freezing at -20 &deg;C.
- Add an extra 3-5 &deg;C to the annealing temperature you would otherwise use.
